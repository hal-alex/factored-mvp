### MVP for Factored

#### Overview

Create a full-stack app that uses React for the frontend and Django REST API for the backend. 

#### Frontend spec

- Users need to have the ability to create an account using email and password
- Users need to have the ability to reset their password using the online form
- Register and login pages are public, all other pages require authentication
- Users need to accept Ts&Cs and Privacy Policy before creating an account
- When logged in, the user has to go through KYC in order to create their first Advance
- Integrate with Persona's API for KYC
- Once KYC'd, they can create their Advance - the flow will include 4 screens:
    - Property address and monthly rent details
    - Document upload for lease agreement, tenant vetting and rent protection
    - Advance finance details - amount of Â£ required, term and other info
    - Bank account details - name, sort code and account number
- Logged in dashboard needs to display a table with user's advances
- User should be able to view their profile e.g. name, email, address

    - Each user needs to have a comment box
    - Each advance needs to show the uploaded documents
    - Each advance needs to have a comment box (?)

    - Active
    - In arrears
