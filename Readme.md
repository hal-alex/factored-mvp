### MVP for Factored

#### Overview

Create a full-stack app that uses React for the frontend and Django REST API for the backend. 

#### Frontend spec

- Users need to have the ability to create an account using email and password
- Users need to have the ability to reset their password using the online form
- Register and login pages are public, all other pages require authentication
- Users need to accept Ts&Cs and Privacy Policy before creating an account
- When logged in,the user has to complete these steps before they can create their Advance
    - Complete Persona's KYC flow (TBC if they provide current address verification)
    - Update their mobile number
    - Go through address history for the last 3 years
- Integrate with Persona's API for KYC
- Once they passed these checks, they can create their Advance - the flow will include 4 screens:
    - Description, reason for advance, property address and monthly rent details
    - Document upload for lease agreement (required), tenant vetting and rent protection (optional)
    - Advance finance details - amount of Â£ required, term and display calculations (formulas TBC)
    - Bank account details - name, sort code and account number
- Logged in dashboard needs to display a table with user's advances (table headings TBC)
- User should be able to view their profile e.g. name, email, current address address (TBC which fields are editable)

#### Backend spec

- Use Django admin panel for user and advance management
    - Each user needs to have a comment box
    - Each advance needs to show the uploaded documents
    - Each advance needs to have a comment box
    - Admin can change the status of each advance
- Use DRF for the REST API 
- Use Postgres for the DB
- Implement unit tests for the users and advances
- Advance will have 5 statuses:
    - Incomplete

    - Active
    - In arrears
    - Repaid
- User's KYC status has to be updated based on their Persona flow outcome

#### Nice-to-haves

- Mobile support
- Integrate soft credit checks into the verification flow
- Two-factor authentication

#### DevOps 

- Host the app on AWS
- Configure the DNS so that the app is hosted on "app.example.com"
- Use Docker (?)
